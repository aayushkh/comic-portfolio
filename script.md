Ever seen a super-hero movie with a bad ending ?
Like the one where the bad guys win ?
Yeah neither have I.

But lets rewind a bit here.
Let me Introduce my self.

I am Aayush Khanna, and for the past year and a half I'm the one and only wannabee fullstack developer.

For starters, just like our friendly neighbourhood spiderman, not only do I love everything on the web.
I try to do everything with utmost love and passion.

And while he swings about fighting crime ...

I fight issue tickets ... 
I fight for every pixel on your screen, every hover state, every minute transition that could mean no less, 

I fight for each and every line of code.

Because that's what makes me a hero.
That's why they call me The <wannabee> Fullstack Developer.

And I do this like every other hero .... I grind, make ends meet, and try to live a normal life.

But being a hero is not easy ...
Every hero needs somebody ...
... For whom he fights for ...

... To give him courage, to make him never lose hope ...
Like Aunt May is to Peter Parker, Martha Kent is to Superman, Alfred is to Batman ...
Every superhero needs a family ...

It's this bond ...
that makes them SUPER-heroes ...

It's the real reason why the bad-guys never win.

Would you be willing to be my family ...
and save this story ...
The End.

Let me fight for you / Let me be your superhero.

Hire The Fullstack Developer to your family !


"When all hope is lost, and there's no end in sight, lift up your eyes, hero's will rise."


Sorry I had to put that in somewhere.

Hi I'm Aayush aka CaptainLevi

Bitten by a radio-active spider during his WebTech class, he starts seeing everything in pixels!
His senses feel responsive to every detail, and he can see every bug and detail
He now feels super responsive to every screen, every bug and obsesses over every detail.

He starts exploring his powers delving into the interweb with WiDeS, 

He's finally invited to join the <Avengers> ICT ...
... where he learns to harness the power of the React-or with imaculate sass ...
Thinking he's finally in control of his powers ... little did he know what lay ahead ...


Prideful of his prior feats, as he begins his internship to face the ultimate challenge, his biggest fear - The Back-End Monster.
He needs to secure an end-point, and the entire HQ depends on him. (dramatic way to say company will sink)

caught in-between the stuggles of his secret identity as a grad student, I failed multiple times ...
... but hero never give up. We fight. We give it our best.

I continued fight the swarm of bugs on the git, made major commits, revamped the user interface ...
... and most importantly he learns how important it is to ask for help when in doubt!

he finally bids goodbye to his alies at the HQ and parts ways ...
he's the hero hackaday deserves, but not the one it needs right now, 
because he can take it, because he's not a hero. he's a silent guardian, a watchful protector ...
the nightwatch

Anyways ..

You're probably wondering why me ...
What's so special about me?
I mean there are so many fullstack super-heros out there right ?
