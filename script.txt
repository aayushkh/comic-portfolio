Ever seen a super-hero movie with a bad ending ?
Like the one where the bad guys win ?
Yeah neither have I.

But lets rewind a bit here.

You're probably wondering who am I ...
What's so special about me?

For starters, think of me as your friendly neighbourhood spiderman, I love everything on the web.

While he swings about fighting crime ...

I fight issue tickets on github and make sure every line of code, every pixel on your screen is goddamn perfect.

They call me The Fullstack Developer.

Like every other hero, I grind, make ends meet, and try to live a normal life.

But being a hero is not easy ...
Every hero needs somebody ...
For whom he fights for ...

To give him courage, to make him never lose hope ...
Like Aunt May is to Peter Parker, Mary Jane is to Clark Kent ...

It's this bond ...
that makes them SUPER-heroes ...

It's the real reason why the bad-guys never win.

Would you be willing to save this story and be my Aunt May ?

Hire The Fullstack Developer and make him a superhero.


"When all hope is lost, and there's no end in sight, lift up your eyes, hero's will rise."
